Gladiators game by Otto Osterman (1405859)

This game is called Gladiators. The base of the game uses the user CRM lab content from the module. Users create their own gladiator that starts with 1 experience point, 100 coins and 20 attack damage. Users can battle each others gladiators. There are three attacks that the user can choose from. The higher the experience level of the user, the more damage their gladiator does. After a battle, users are rewarded with experience points and coins. The amount depends on if the outcome was a win or a loss. Users can see a leaderboard in the battle page. It shows which gladiator has the most wins. Users can chat with each other in real time.

A market system was also implemented, but it is not functioning. The market has weapons and each weapon has a 'Purchase' button, but nothing happens if clicked. The idea was to bind the purchased weapon to the user and then the user would get a higher attack damage or a chance to do a critical hit for double damage. Having teams of gladiators was also considered, but that would have made the battle system very complicated. As for graphics, a background image was added. Also, when in battle, users have a picture of their gladiator next to their stats. Another thing I would have liked to add is the ability for users to choose their gladiator avatar.
